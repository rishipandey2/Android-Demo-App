# Android Development Demo App  

This project is a **Demo App** designed to serve as a practice ground for my Android development learning journey. It incorporates features and concepts I learn during my study of the basics of Android development, allowing me to solidify my understanding by implementing them in a practical way.

## üìù About the Project  

The goal of this app is to experiment with various Android development concepts, frameworks, and tools. Each feature implemented in the app represents a topic or technique that I have learned, making this app a personal portfolio of my Android development skills.  

This project is continually evolving as I learn and explore new concepts.
